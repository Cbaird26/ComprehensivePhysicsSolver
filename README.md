# OmniSolve: The Universal Solution System

[![CI](https://github.com/Cbaird26/ComprehensivePhysicsSolver/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Cbaird26/ComprehensivePhysicsSolver/actions)

## Overview

OmniSolve is a comprehensive software system that integrates scientific principles from quantum gravity and relativity, ecological impact modeling, and machine learning into a unified framework. This system is designed to address complex problems by providing a holistic approach that combines physics, environmental science, and artificial intelligence.

## Features

- **Quantum-Relativity Framework**: Calculates energies in quantum gravity and relativistic regimes.
- **Ecological Modeling**: Simulates ecological impacts over time and assesses the ecological impact based on resource use and pollution levels.
- **Machine Learning**: Implements linear regression and neural network models for predictive analysis.
- **Integrated System**: Combines all functionalities to provide comprehensive results based on user inputs.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- SciPy
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow

## Installation

To install the required packages, run:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy scikit-learn tensorflow
```

## Experiments
